https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/algorithms/find-the-symmetric-difference
The mathematical term symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets but not in both.
Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of their symmetric difference.
The returned array must contain only unique values (no duplicates).
